    "Load the image *dog.jpg* and compute the economy SVD. Compute the relative reconstruction error of the truncated SVD in the *Frobenius* norm as a function of the rank *r*. Square this error to compute the fraction of missing variance as a function of *r*. You may also decide to plot 1 minus the error or missing variance to visualize the amount of norm or variance captured at a given rank *r*.  \n",

Compare this with the rank *r* where the reconstruction captures 99% in the Frobenius norm and with the rank *r* that captures 99% of the cumulative sum of singular values.\n"
